PolarSys B612 font family - https://github.com/polarsys/b612

In 2010, Airbus initiated a research collaboration with [ENAC](http://www.enac.fr) and [Université de Toulouse III](http://www.univ-tlse3.fr/) on a prospective study to define and validate an “Aeronautical Font”: the challenge was to improve the display of information on the cockpit screens, in particular in terms of legibility and comfort of reading, and to optimize the overall homogeneity of the cockpit.

2 years later, [Airbus](https://www.airbus.com) came to find [Intactile DESIGN](https://intactile.com) to work on the design of the eight typographic variants of the font. This one, baptized B612 in reference to the imaginary asteroid of the aviator Saint‑Exupéry, benefited from a complete hinting on all the characters.

See page 11 of leaflet.pdf about comparison between characters fo differents fonts from Humanist to Technical.

(1) License unknown to our knowledge. Humanist 521 fonts are available for free on many fonts web sites. We got theses Humanist 521 fonts from our Corel Ventura 4.2 for Windows 3 software acquired in 1993. We still have the ~380 pages Corel Ventura original book gathering fonts, portraits, animals, icons and so on, where Humanist 521 (~Gill Sans) fonts and its variants are printed on left F15 page. The Corel Ventura book does not specify any fonts license nor usage limitation. But then, we saw Monotype has acquired Bitstream and we've got serious reasons to believe Humaninst 521 Lt BT font falls into commercial license rules. 

When in doubt, and assuming that the Humanist font was a thing of the past (no €¢ sign for example), we found the very legible B612 font to be relevant.
